# FishGameTwoTheFishening
FishGameTwoTheFishening is a project I worked on for CMSC132 at the University of Maryland. I have created this game using Java. Some of the skills I learned include using graphics and keyboard interactivity in Java. This project also helped me strengthen my knowledge and appropriate use of inheritance and abstraction, some of the pillars of object-oriented programming.

# To Play
To play FishGameTwoTheFishening, simply run FishGameTwoTheFishening.java and use your arrow keys to navigate around the screen, avoiding sharks and catching kelp!
